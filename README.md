# Faster Geometry 2D
## Intro
This GDExtension currently only helps to speed up a few things:
- A Delaunator
- Poisson Disc Sampling

Both things are quite slow and inefficient, so I created this GDExtension to wrap external libraries, not created by me.
Beware, I have very little experience in C++ so the code quality might not fulfill everyones standards.
